We hope you'll enjoy a high-quality competition here, battling for knowledge and fun. To enhance your participation, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Please follow the contest rules and refrain from using any cheating methods. Avoid discussing problem-related information or solutions with anyone other than your teammates during the contest, and definitely do not share answers.
2. Abide by community norms and avoid posting any unfriendly remarks in the contest communication group.
3. Until the contest concludes, refrain from discussing problem details or strategies in public.
4. After the contest ends and until the contest materials are archived, do not publicly share your complete solutions.
5. The organizers may have additional specific instructions, which will be communicated before the contest. Their decisions are final.

Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in disqualification or account suspension. We believe that most participants are friendly, and we hope you are too! Œ¶œâŒ¶
